# Zombie Shooting Game
Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzlZg1Ys3ns&t=9s

First game I created for Computer Science AP final.

Built in Java. Assets are modified from Metal Slug and Minecraft. Utilizes MouseListeners for aiming. 
Learned the basics of animation, ray collision, and controls.

Gameplay: More zombies spawn the higher your score goes. Game ends when you lose all your health.
